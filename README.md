Continuous Integration
----------------------

### Circle CI

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits
to your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. Circle is 
configured using the `circle.yml` file. You need to sign up for Circle and enable this project, then
set up Heroku deployment from Circle. To make this work, you need to create a herokuapp and put the
name of that app in `circle.yml`.
